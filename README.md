# React-Native-ToDo-App

## Description
 
 This is a ToDo Application built with ReactNative, Firebase and JSX.

## Initialization

Assuming that you have Node 12 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

`npm install -g expo-cli`

Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "Your_ProjectName":

`expo init Your_ProjectName`

`cd Your_ProjectName`

`npm start` # you can also use: `expo start`

This will start a development server for you.
